### Enabling instructors to offer explorations into data science
workshop modules are short explorations into data science that give students the opportunity to work hands-on with a data set relevant to their course and receive some instruction on the principles of data analysis, statistics, and computing.

With help from the Workshop module development team, a module can be designed and taught in an existing course from any discipline or field.

### What does a module actually look like?
Modules vary widely and are customized based on each instructorâ€™s objectives and the type of course. A module might be simply one or two lectures about how to interpret data and statistics in news media reports, or it might be a multiple-session research workshop for students working on a data-centered project.

### What are the benefits of adding a workshop module to a course?
Modules are a great way for students to have a smooth and supported introduction to computing, statistics, and the tools used in data science, which are increasingly relevant across academic disciplines.

Modules empower students to do their own research and pose their own questions using data and enable instructors to apply a new lens to their area of expertise.

### What kinds of technology and tools are involved?
Students in modules learn to use the [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and other programming languages and in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), both gold-standard data science tools that are used in the [Data Science Education Program](https://data.berkeley.edu/).

### Who can help me with creating a workshop module?
Instructors interested in adding a workshop module to their courses can contact the D-Lab Instructional Services Team.
