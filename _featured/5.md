An introduction to visualization with Python. We'll cover visualization theory and plotting with Matplotlib and Seaborn, working through examples in a Jupyter notebook. The plot types that will be covered include: line, bar, scatter, boxplot. We'll also learn about styles and customizing plots. Throughout the workshop, we'll discuss the plot types best suited for particular kinds of data. Basic familiarity with Python is assumed.
