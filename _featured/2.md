In this workshop, we provide an introduction to data wrangling with Python. We will do so largely with the pandas package, which provides a rich set of tools to manipulate and interact with data frames, the most common data structure used when analyzing tabular data. We'll learn how to manipulate, index, merge, group, and plot data frames using pandas functions.
